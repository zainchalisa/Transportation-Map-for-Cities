# Transportation-Map-for-Cities
This was a Java program that built a transportation system for a city. The program used linked lists to make the system, remove stations, add stations, 
create a duplicate map, and add a new type of transportation for the city. This program exemplified how software can be the immediate solution to many problems we face on a day-to-day basis.

The Driver was provided to me for this program, I coded all the methods in the Transit.java file.

If you would like to test the program out use the txt files I provided in the repository. You can use input 1,2, or 3 to pull the initial data for the program to run the first 5 methods. To run the last method you will need to use the corresponding scooter file. For example you will need to run scooter2.txt if running input2.txt for the program to work.
