# Transportation-Map-for-Cities
This was a Java program that built a transportation system for a city.  
The program used linked lists to make the system, remove stations, add stations, 
create a duplicate map, and add a new type of transportation for the city. 
This program exemplified how software can be the immediate solution to many problems 
we face on a day-to-day basis.

The Driver was provided to me for this program, I coded all the methods in the Transit.java file.
